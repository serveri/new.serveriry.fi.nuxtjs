      <p>Code Of Conduct:</p> 
      <br>

      <p>"Safer spaces" is a term used to describe the communal effort to create environments that promote safety. In practice, a safer space involves the student organization and its members taking responsibility for challenging situations. Conflicts are addressed instead of being tolerated.
      </p>
      <br>

      <p>1. It is important to be respectful, avoiding any questioning of someone's differences. Handle sensitive topics with care, and ensure that everyone has a voice and is included.</p>
      <br>


      <p>2. Respect everyone's physical and mental well-being, as well as their right to self-determination. Do not make assumptions based on stereotypes.</p>
      <br>

      <p>3. Avoid reproducing racist or discriminatory stereotypes, even if intended as "jokes" or irony. Do not harass anyone verbally, physically, or visually. If someone says "no," respect their boundaries and change your behavior if necessary.</p>
      <br>

      <p>4. If you disagree with someone, try to express your opinion constructively and peacefully. Focus on the issue, not the person.</p>
      <br>

      <p>5. If a situation feels uncomfortable, raise it with the organization's board or leadership. You can also give feedback anonymously.</p>
      <br>

      <p>6. It is essential to intervene if you witness racism, discrimination, harassment, or any other inappropriate behavior.</p>
